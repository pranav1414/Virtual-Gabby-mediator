# Virtual Gabby - AI-Powered Virtual Mediator for Parents
Overview
Virtual Gabby is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist parents in conflict resolution with the ultimate goal of creating a personalized parenting plan. Unlike traditional co-parenting apps that focus on schedules or payments, Virtual Gabby serves as a neutral mediator, helping parents collaboratively reach agreements that prioritize their childâ€™s well-being.

This project is not a legal service, but rather a tool to facilitate meaningful communication between parents, allowing them to create their own solutions. Virtual Gabby enhances human interaction through AI, adapting to each parent's unique needs and emotional state, creating a personalized mediation experience.

# Project Objectives
1) Initial Communication: Engage separately with each parent to assess their level of agreement and conflict.
2) Conflict Resolution: Facilitate ongoing dialogue to help parents reach consensus through adaptive, personalized AI.
3) Education: Provide parents with valuable legal information and co-parenting strategies (not legal advice).
4) Parenting Plan Draft: Generate a preliminary parenting plan, which parents can review with legal counsel.

# Key Features
1) Asynchronous Communication: Virtual Gabby communicates separately with each parent (Parent 1 and Parent 2) through typed or voice messages (future feature), allowing flexibility in communication styles.
2) Conflict Assessment: Before engaging with parents, Virtual Gabby screens for high-conflict situations or domestic violence, disqualifying such cases from using the app.
3) Educational Component: Provides essential legal concepts, co-parenting tools, and conflict-resolution frameworks to help guide parents toward mutual understanding and agreement.
4) Neutral Mediation: Acts as a neutral third party, helping parents move toward common ground by focusing on the child's best interests rather than personal positions.
5) Sentiment Analysis: Uses AI-driven sentiment analysis to uncover and address underlying issues that may not be explicitly stated by the parents.
6) Parenting Plan Drafting: Generates a non-binding draft parenting plan, serving as a term sheet that parents can present to legal professionals for finalization.

# How Virtual Gabby Works
Step 1: Virtual Gabby begins by individually assessing each parent's conflict level and understanding their needs.

Step 2: Through continuous dialogue, Virtual Gabby mediates between parents, encouraging open communication and guiding them toward agreements that benefit their child.

Step 3: Virtual Gabby educates parents on co-parenting best practices and relevant legal concepts.

Step 4: Once the discussions conclude, Virtual Gabby drafts a parenting plan, which parents can take to a lawyer or appropriate court body for review and finalization.

# Future Capabilities (Planned for Future Releases)
Voice Interaction: Adding the option for voice-based communication, enhancing accessibility and interaction.
Facial Recognition: Exploring the potential to incorporate facial recognition technology to better understand and respond to parents' emotions during mediation.

# Conclusion
Virtual Gabby represents an innovative use of AI to facilitate conflict resolution between parents. By promoting collaborative communication and providing personalized mediation, Virtual Gabby helps parents create agreements that truly work for them and their children. With future capabilities like voice interaction and emotion recognition, Virtual Gabby aims to redefine the co-parenting experience in the digital age.
